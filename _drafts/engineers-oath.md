The future is the union of what we all put our time towards
  engineers play a big part in it
The market doesn't determine what is right and wrong
  laws can, but not always
Build the future you want your kids to live in

Question why, 'ignorance is bliss' is not acceptable
Do things consistent with your own moral code
Speak up - to the extent you can
Stories about when punished for doing what you believed was right

vs lawyers - not everyone is entitled to an engineer
vs medical - no clear right and wrong
