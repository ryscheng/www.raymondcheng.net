technology has given a small group of people the ability to exert/ scale influence much more than before.
  mass population control is possible in ways never seen before
technology can be as much of a top-down oppressive force, as much as a bottoms-up empowering force.

if our lives are shaped or controlled by implicit coercion vs explicit force, are we any less free?

personal space, and diverse choices is the key to free will
  diverse choices - not just the ones pre-determined by others with their own agendas
  personal space - the ability to achieve independent thought
  without it, what's left of our humanity?

People are worried about the singularity being an existential threat to humanity
  I think the more immediate concern is the asymmetry of power amongst the people already on this planet
  and how technology is exacerbating those asymmetries
  not just economic - that's peanuts compared to political power
