I don't like labeling people. Like I don't like calling people "lazy", or calling people "smart". I think anyone can choose to work or choose to know something (by studying), but I tend to avoid language that implies we can't overcome our nature.
I think labeling choices or actions is different, but to label a person is to tell a fiction anyway, usually self-reinforcing in a positive or negative (manipulative) way
It's a long way of saying I've always believed anyone can be anything
Which I hold myself to, as well as wanna impart to my kids
