The state of privacy is because developers decided to architect their systems this way

Solve, consumers buy else
Policy forces change
Consumer devices adversarial
Developers care
Why should they care? Liability, morality,

things get cheaper
  historically, meant we could own ore ourselves
  now - fundamentally different - service mentality
    data entitlement

Moral obligation of developers, not users

Current:


Problem:

Proposal:
Define a Personal domain - any data generated by a user (directly or indirectly)
  Data is encrypted at rest
  Exportable copy of data
  No records by default - Logs about user actions are deleted
  Consent - keys held by user by default.
  Secure user-owned devices
  Make compromises and data requests known. If not legally possible, adjust tech so that it is.
