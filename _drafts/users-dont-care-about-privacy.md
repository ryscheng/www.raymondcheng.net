users don't care about 
- the environment (e.g.H&M incineration)
- Arbitration rights
- Paid sick/family leave

Obviously stupid example
- not just about loss, also about opportunity cost

Flawed logic
- need large percentage to use feature to matter - (e.g. fine food)
- need large people to incur switching costs for it
  - experiments with false choices have meaning
  - thoughts about free will

Ways to look at this:
- Good for society
- Human rights - always come at a cost to other things to optimize for
