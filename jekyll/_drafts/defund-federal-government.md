Electoral college / Senate
  don't represent most Americans.

Potential path to consider:
- reduce funding to federal government
- Increase fund state governments
  allow progressive states to take more collective action together

Open questions?
- How is this different from the union splitting up?
  What should continue to be done together?
- How do you prevent free-loading?
