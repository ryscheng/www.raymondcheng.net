  - Free will
    Choice maximalism
    Env provide choice
    Individual to make them - close other opportunities
    modern definition of freedom


Robot overlords are already here
  don't need AGI - we have people to do that
    2 issues: who/how defines the optimization function (TBD)
    if we have the same societal optimization functions we have today
      then we already have human-level intelligence doing it (albeit slower)
  optimization functions
    companies - maximize revenue or audience/reach (aka revenue)
    politics - maximize power. different functions in each country
    non-profits - lives saved?


Free will
  we live in a world of false choices
    most of these studies are based on fully controlling the environment around you
  what if there were spaces that cannot be controlled?

Maximizing spaces is key
  let people show their inner freak

If maximizing for minimal violations of existing laws
  founders would not have made a bill of rights
  so why is it important?
  maybe has to do with navigating a world where there's too many unknowns?
