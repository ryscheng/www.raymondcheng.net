  - Engineer - avoid working for marketers [ ]
    self-promotion vs servant leaders
    work for people you trust
    Avoid: no good/evil, trust us, you're paranoid

No idols
  you only see the curated public persona
  they're people with their own flaws
  if you idolize historical figures - realize you're idolizing a limited idea they represent, not the person

Achievement fallacy
  many steps you don't even see
  it's about growth, dy/dx, not x
    good habits are how you get too acceleration
