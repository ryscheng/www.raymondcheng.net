Plasmic is a visual builder for the web. Non-developers can build pages or parts of pages, and developers can integrate these into any website or app codebase.

The goal is to empower and unblock non-developers such as marketers and designers, while freeing up developers from pixel-pushing. Teams can thus move faster, iterate more, and ship higher quality products.

Plasmic as a page builder and “visual CMS” is its simplest and most common use case. Editors can create and update content in Plasmic without code, and publish this into their production site without needing to block on developers.

Beyond website content, Plasmic can even be used to create frontends for complex web applications (such as Plasmic itself, which was built in Plasmic). This is possible because—despite being easy to start with—Plasmic gives you full visual control and works deeply with code.
