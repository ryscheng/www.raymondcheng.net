Existing smart contracts systems inherit the availability and other security assurances of blockchains, however, they are impeded by blockchainsâ€™ lack of confidentiality and poor performance. Ekiden is a system that addresses these gaps by combining blockchains with Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), such as Intel SGX. Capable of operating on any desired blockchain, Ekiden permits concurrent, off-chain execution of smart contracts within TEE-backed compute nodes, yielding high performance, low cost, and confidentiality for sensitive data.
