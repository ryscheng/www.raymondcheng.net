<b>RaymondCheng.net Terminal</b><br>
In 2008, before the days of Google powered by knowledge graph and Mozilla Ubiquity,
I designed a website that reflected my favorite computing environment, a console interface.
RAy SHell = RASH. It's modular, simple, clean, requires no JavaScript, and certainly not for 
the faint-of-heart. Written entirely in server-side PHP. Discontinued as of 2013.<br>
