![autodapp](/img/projects/autodapp.png)

AutoDapp helps developers use existing, mature web stacks to build decentralized apps (dApps), enabling them to switch between a centralized cloud deployment and a decentralized deployment with only a single line of code change. AutoDapp can also be used to instantly convert existing web apps into dApps. Letâ€™s AutoDapp-ify the Web!
