# oss-directory

OSS projects produce many work artifacts (eg, git repos, smart contracts). But it takes inside knowledge to know where to find them. We created a schema for mapping artifacts to OSS projects. We built an initial directory of 100+ OSS projects on OP and deployed it to EAS. oss-directory was started at ETHGlobal Superhack 2023, where it won "Best App for RetroPGF, PG, or Impact".
