# Auto Retro Funding

![autoretrofunding](https://github.com/opensource-observer/ethglobal-sf-2024/raw/main/assets/web_landing.png)

AutoRF is retro funding made simple. Project impact metrics are regularly indexed, which is used to configure on-chain splits contracts to reward projects over regular settlement periods. We launched “The Grinder’s Fund”, to reward the hardest working projects at ETHGlobal SF.
