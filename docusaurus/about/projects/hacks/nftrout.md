# NFTrout

![nftrout](/img/projects/nftrout.png)

NFTrout is a new NFT platform for generative artists. We are building an off-chain privacy-preserving runtime using trusted execution environments (e.g. Intel SGX), called [Escrin](https://escrin.org/). Artists store secrets in the off-chain system to generate new NFT art. NFTrout was started at ETHDenver 2023 and won "Best project using Filecoin Virtual Machine".
