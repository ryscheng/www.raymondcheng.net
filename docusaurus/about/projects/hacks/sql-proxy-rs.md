# sql-proxy-rs

sql-proxy-rs is a programmable Postgres/MariaDB Proxy for Rust. You can write custom handlers to either monitor SQL traffic, or transform SQL queries in-line.

This was written to help support the [AutoDapp](https://www.autodapp.io/) project, since nothing like this existed at the time.
