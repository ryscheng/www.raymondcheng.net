# hypem-dl

Inspired by [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl),
hypem-dl makes it easy to download a playlist of songs off of [Hype Machine](https://hypem.com/),
into a directory of local MP3 files. For example, to download the first page of the popular page:

```bash
npx hypem-dl --slug popular
```

Check out the README on GitHub for instructions on how to use it.
