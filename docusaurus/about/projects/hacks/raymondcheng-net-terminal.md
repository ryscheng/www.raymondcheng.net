In 2008, before the days of Google powered by knowledge graph and Mozilla Ubiquity, I designed a website that reflected my favorite computing environment, a console interface. RAy SHell = RASH. Itâ€™s modular, simple, clean, requires no JavaScript, and certainly not for the faint-of-heart. Written entirely in server-side PHP. Discontinued as of 2013.
