# ImpactGPT

![impactgpt](/img/projects/impactgpt.png)

ImpactGPT will use GPT3 to uncover the highest impact historical work and mint hypercerts for retroactive funding. Our goal is to retroactively reward potentially under-appreciated scientists and contributors. ImpactGPT was built for ETHDenver 2023 and won the "Quantifying the Qualitative Impact" bounty.
