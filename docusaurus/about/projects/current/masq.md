# MASQ Foundation

![masq](/img/projects/masq.png)

The MASQ Foundation exists to improve security, privacy, and decentralization for the public good. We research, build, and teach about widely-accessible technologies that empower individual users and local communities. Our goal is to make both the digital and physical worlds more secure, respect privacy, and decentralized in power, while spurring new economic, coordination, and governance models. We believe that decentralization can lead to a world that out-innovates the extractive companies of today.
