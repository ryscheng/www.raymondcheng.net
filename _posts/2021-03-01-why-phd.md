Vision
  grounded in reality / strategy
and the skills to pursue it

- high drop out rate - many don't know what they signed up for
- advice is lacking - find a good mentor
- PhD is lonely
- Thesis - push the edge of some small subject

- The goal at the end of grad school is independence
  wrt guidance, advising, mentoring "you are responsible for your own successes and failures"
- Mentor vs advisor - not the same thing
- Academic freedom - define it, often not what you think
- Must love answering questions
  building something new isn't sufficient, not all problems are technical in nature
- Don't stop learning
- Build community, don't dismiss it
- Know how to utilize the resources around you
  including your advisor
- Work on soft skills - teamwork, speaking, writing
