For years, my website was a single gigantic HTML file. Adding content and making edits felt a lot like stacking Jenga blocks a mile high. While that was fun in many ways, it is 2015 and it is time to move to some form of automated system like Jekyll.

On here, you can expect to see more transparency into my research, my thoughts, and projects.
Enjoy!
