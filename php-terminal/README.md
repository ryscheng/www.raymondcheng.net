================

Archive of the PHP site I built in 2008.
Allowed you to `ls` and `cat` your way through my biography.
Done entirely as server-side code due to a (at the time) newly-found distrust of JavaScript.

Also allowed for shortcut commands (i.e. `map`, `weather`, `search`)
before the days of Mozilla Ubiquity.

Unfortunately, I've since taken this offline and replaced it with a static page.
