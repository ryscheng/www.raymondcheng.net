Back to Tipton from Deale
	Follow the powerlines
	Stay between oval tracks and drag strip
	330 deg heading to Tipton
	Don't pass substation or water tower

Pitch <==> Speed
Power <==> Altitude
	If high, reduce power and pitch down
	If low, add power and maintain alt.

LANDINGS
	1.) Abeam numbers - RPM to 1500-1700, carb heat on
	2.) Bleed airspeed until in white speed arc, then 10 deg flaps, 75 kts
	3.) Turn Base @45 deg from runway, then 20 deg flags, 65 kts
	4.) Turn Final, then 30 deg flaps, 60 kts, 1300RPM
	Crosswind -> bank into wind, opposite rudder
  If misaligned -> ailerons to bring back, kick rudder to align
	Slip (fast descend) -> nose into wind, bank towards runway, opposite rudder
		Note: rudder ALL the way in
	5.) Focus on extended centerline - eyes on the numbers
		Keep numbers on same part of windshield
    Shift body weight to center of cockpit to center self
	6.) Power to idle when runway is made
		When 40 ft off ground (about wingspan), round out (DONT ROUND OUT EARLY!!!)
    Level flight first - eyes on the end of the runway (sight picture)
    When the plane starts to drop, pull back 1 inch on yoke (flare)
		Only gentle additions to back pressure
    If back up - level flight, when drop, 2 inches of back pressure
Emergency Landings
  ABC
    Airspeed 60kts
    Best landing site
    Cockpit - radio/transponder/restart engine
  Key position - aim such that you are 1000AGL abeam the numbers of runway
	Pitch for best glide (60kts)
    Aggressively use trim to relieve back pressure
	Don't use flaps until runway is made
	Aim for midway first
	If after takeoff, land in field out front
	If during beginning of downwind/crosswind, take opposite runway, declare emergency
  Make sure you still have a square traffic pattern

Short-field takeoff - elevator back pressure all the way
Climb out at Vx, then Vy, then flaps up

Maneuvers
	Always make sure to focus forward
	Pick a point and fly to it
	Scan for traffic
	Don't drift in slow flight (right rudder) -> +/- 10 degrees
	Turns around a point +/- 100 ft altitude

Steep Turn
  Maintain altitude!!!
  Lower speed to 90kts
  Count 10deg, 20deg, 
  at 30deg, push in another 150RPM
  pull back on the yoke
  Maintain - altitude, 45deg bank, go around 360 degrees
Turns around a point
  Pick landmark - prominent, not crowded
  600-1000 AGL
  Enter on the 45deg downwind
  GROUNDSPEED - Wind correction to account for tail/headwind
  Balance - Check front: traffic
    Side: Distance from landmark
    Instruments: altitude
Power-off stall - Landing configuration
  MAINTAIN HEADING
  Lower airspeed - 1700RPM
  Carb heat on, 10deg flaps
  75kts
  30deg flaps - release yoke and descend
  at 65kts, pull throttle to idle
  Pull back to stall
  Recovery - carb heat on, throttle in
  raise flaps slowly 10deg at a time
  Minimize altitude lost
Power-on stall
  NO FLAPS, MAINTAIN HEADING
  Lower RPM to 2200
  Pitch up, maintain altitude to bleed airspeed to 65kts
  Full throttle and pitch up until stall
  BE CAREFUL WITH RUDDER - STEP ON BALL
  Recovery - pitch down and level
    If start to spin DO NOT use ailerons, use rudder
Slow Flight
  MAINTAIN ALTITUDE AND HEADING
  Lower airspeed 1700RPM
  Carb heat on, 10 deg flaps
  20deg flaps - maintain altitude
  30deg flaps - maintain altitude
  Slow slow slow turns
  Use right rudder - step on the ball
  Recovery - do procedure backwards - maintain heading and altitude

Practice Radio, navigational maps
