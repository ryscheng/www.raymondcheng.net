	Operation
		Make sure oil pressure is good after start
		Make sure aux. fuel pump is off after start/takeoff/landing
		Upon engine failure, immediately pitch for best glide and land
		Throttle controls manifold pressure, propellor pitch controls RPM
		Always enrich mixture before changing throttle or adjusting altitude, then lean when stable
		Carburetor Icing - loss of engine RPM, apply Carb heat
		Overheating causes - lower-octane fuel, too much power, mixture too lean
			fix = enrich mixture, reduce rate of climb, increase airspeed
		Oil temp too high - not enough oil
		Detonation - explosions in cylinder - cause=lower-octane fuel, fix = increase airspeed
		Pre-ignition - firing of cylinder before spark - get mechanic
		Maneuvering - straight/level, turns, climbs, descents
	Vision - scan for traffic - focus on small segments for short intervals
		haze makes planes look farther away
		night, use peripheral vision
